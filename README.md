# scientific-calculator
This is a scientific calculator that looks like the casio fx-991es plus.
Everything was made with the QT ide and the C++ programming language.
The app itself is actually just 220Kb, but it reqires some .dll file to run on your sysrem;
To ensure the app runs smoothly please download everything.
its not complete as i will still be updating it

Thanks
